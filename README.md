## Usage of this Template
We strongly recommend to use this Project as a whole, since this ensures that you have access to the Original Template and all Library-Files so you can modify them as per your liking.

If you want to modify the template itself you can do so in the `clean-dhbw` template where the configuration of this Project is stored.

Since the Template was developt using the [Tinymist](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist) VSCode-extension, it should be used in this environemnt to avoid unforseeing Bugs and Errors.

This Template follows the recommendations of the DHBW Stuttgart, though it remains an unofficial template.

Be sure to configure the font to your preference.
