# Credit
This Repo uses the clean-dhbw project from here: https://github.com/roland-KA/clean-dhbw-typst-template
Most of this Template is from said repository. Many thanks.

# Usage of this Template
This template is designed to be used as a complete project, giving you access to all library files for customization.

It follows the recommendations of DHBW Stuttgart, though it remains an unofficial template.
Be sure to configure the font to your preference.

I recommend using the [Tinymist](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist) extension in VSCode.
